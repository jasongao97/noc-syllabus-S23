# Evaluation for IMA (Undergrad)

Grades for the course will follow the standard A through F letter grading system and will be determined by the following breakdown:

- 25% Participation
- 50% Assignments
- 25% Final project

At most two (2) unexcused absences will be tolerated without effect to your grade. Any more than two (2) unexcused absences will result a lowering of your final grade by one whole grade for each unexcused absence. For example, three (3) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a B instead of an A. Four (4) unexcused absences will result in your highest possible grade being a C and so on. Six (6) unexcused absences would result in an automatic F for the course. Two (2) late arrivals will count for one (1) absence.

## Assignment Grading

There will be regular assignments that are relevant the class material. These assignments must be documented (written description, photos, screenshots, screen recording, code, and video all qualify based on the assignment) on a web platform of your choice. You are required to link to your assignment from the course repo (you may choose to use a privately shared google doc or password protected website if you prefer.) The due dates are specified on the assignment page.

It is expected that you will spend 4 to 6 hours a week on the class outside of class itself. This will include reviewing material, reading, watching video, completing assignments and so on. Please budget your time accordingly.

Each assignment will be marked as complete (full credit), partially complete (half credit), or incomplete (no credit). To be complete an assignment should meet the criteria specified in the syllabus including documentation. If significant portions are not attempted or the assignment is turned in late (up to 1 week) then it may be marked partially complete. If it is more than a week late, not turned in, or an attempt isnâ€™t made to meet the criteria specified it will be marked incomplete.

Assignment documentation is expected to be 200 to 500 words in length unless otherwise specified.
